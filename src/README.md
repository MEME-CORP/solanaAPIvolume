# Solana Integration Module

This module provides a complete Solana blockchain integration for the NinjaBot project, enabling wallet management, transaction execution, and scheduling capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

The integration uses Solana's web3.js SDK (v1.87.6) to interact with Solana devnet/mainnet and provides the following core functionalities:

- Wallet generation and management
- Transaction execution with retry mechanisms and fee optimization
- Token transfers (SOL and SPL tokens)
- Fee spike detection and prioritization

## Recent Fixes

The following issues were resolved during development:

1. **Web3.js v1 Compatibility**: Updated the entire codebase to work with web3.js v1.87.6 instead of v2
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Fixed transaction confirmation logic to use standard web3.js Connection methods
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Replaced missing @solana/kit functionality with custom utilities
4. **Mother Wallet Handling**: Fixed wallet creation and management for the integration workflow
5. **Solana Keypair Integration**: Properly implemented Keypair management for transaction signatures

## Module Structure

- `integration/`: Main integration workflow and wallet storage
- `transactions/`: Transaction creation, signing, and execution
- `wallet/`: Wallet management and key handling
- `fees/`: Fee calculation and optimization
- `tokens/`: Token account management
- `utils/`: Utility functions including RPC client
- `models/`: Type definitions

## Compatibility Notes

This module is designed to work with:
- @solana/web3.js v1.87.6
- @solana/spl-token v0.3.8
- Node.js v16+

## Usage

For running on devnet:

```typescript
const manager = createIntegrationManager();
await manager.runCompleteWorkflow(5, 1, 10);
```

This will create 5 child wallets, fund them with 1 SOL each, and execute transactions totaling 10 SOL in volume.

## Testing

```
# Run integration test
npm run integration

# Check balance of a wallet
npm run check-balance -- --address <wallet-address>
```
